/* Creating Reasorces:

Resources are special type of structs which can't be copied or discarded, Only the key can be used to store value.
Resorces are stored under account.
An account can hold only one resource of a given type at a time.

move_to<T>(&signer, T) --> to give a resource, will abort if account already has that resource.
move_from<T>(address):T --> delete T from account, will abort if account does not have T.
borrow_global_mut<T>(address):&mut T --> borrow Mutable reference.
borrow_global<T>(address):&T --> borrow Immutable reference.
exists<T>(address):bool --> checks if T exists at the address, won't abort at all.

when function accesses a resource usinf move_from, borrow_global or borrow_global_mut, 
the function must indicate that it "acquires" that resource.
This is then used by Move's type system to ensure the references into global storage are safe, 
specifically that there are no dangling references into global storage.
