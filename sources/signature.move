/* Signer : It is an in-built resource type for move. signer values cannot be created via literals.
signers should come first in the list of arguments for a function in script. we will be looking at two functions:
signer::address_of(&signer):address --> Returns the address wrapped by this signer &singer
signer::borrow_address(&signer):&address --> Returns a reference to the address wrapped by this signer */
